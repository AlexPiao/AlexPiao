# Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I am Minshuo(Alex) Piao

**ðŸŽ“ Graduate Student | Quantitative Methods in the Social Science (Data Science Focus)**
I am passionate about the intersection of Data Analysis, Marketing Strategy, and Consumer Behaviors. My journey has taken me from Engineering (Automation) when I was an undergraduate. After that, aiming to combine mathematical skills in the Advertising field, I transferred to the major of Public Relations after a competitive interview. To acquire further progress in leveraging quantitative methods and the business world, I am pursuing a Master's Degree in the QMSS program at Columbia University. Recently, Iâ€™ve focused on **AI-driven tools for education** and further exploring the **mathematics of model building**.
